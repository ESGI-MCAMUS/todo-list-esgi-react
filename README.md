# TODO List React App

This project has been created and maintained by [@MisterGoodDeal](https://github.com/MisterGoodDeal), [@ThomasGeoffron](https://github.com/ThomasGeoffron) and [@Haborym](https://github.com/Haborym) for the course `Test unitaire @ ESGI`.

First things first, you have to clone 2 projects:
- Frontend (React App)
- Backend (NodeJS + Express app)

Then install all dependencies on both projects with the command `npm install`.

You also need to run a database locally (XAMP, WAMP...). Please refer to the [`README.md` of the backend](https://github.com/MisterGoodDeal/todo-list-esgi-server) to run it properly

## Start the app

**⚠️ Run the backend first, otherwise the app will either show a white screen or crash!**

Run the command `npm start` to launche the React App. You can access it via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running tests

In order to run tests, you **MUST** start the database and the backend first, then the React project.

In order to run test, type `npm run test:e2e` in the terminal.
